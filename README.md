# Dynamic-Weapon-Wheel-for-Unity
Thanks to the lovely people at r/Unity3D, I was able to put together this weapon wheel. It's for anybody who wishes to use it. When I made this, I needed a weapon wheel and, initially, I didn't know how many segments I needed the wheel to be made of. 
All the tutorials I found online were tutorials of people going into their image editing software and chopping a circle up into equal bits. 
It would be nice, I thought, to have a wheel that you can whip up right there in Unity; 
One where the segments can dynamically resize themselves if the segment number should change. 
This is what I came up with.
Behold, my first actual contribution.
