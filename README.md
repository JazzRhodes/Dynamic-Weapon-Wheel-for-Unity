# Dynamic-Weapon-Wheel-for-Unity
Thanks to some lovely people at r/Unity3D, I was able to put together this weapon wheel. It's for anybody who wishes to use it. I recently needed a weapon wheel and I didn't know at first the number of segments I wanted the wheel to be made of. 
All the tutorials I found online were tutorials of people going into their image editing software and chopping a circle up into equal bits. 
It would be nice, I thought, to have a wheel that you can whip up right there in Unity; 
One where the segments can dynamically resize themselves if the segment number should change. 
So this is what I came up with so far.
